# Contributing to Imager

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this Script as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed Scripts, update the Readme.md.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/santoshvandari/Imager/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample queries if possible
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happened
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all.
